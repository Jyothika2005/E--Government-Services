Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around for some decades in several theoretical forms and complicated systems; however, only recent advances in computational powers and big data have enabled AI to achieve outstanding results in an ever-growing number of domains. For example, AI have tremendously advanced the areas of computer vision, medical applications, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and several other domains.AI can be defined as the ability of a computer to imitate the intelligence of human behavior while improving its own performance. AI is not only robotics, rather an intelligent behavior of an autonomous machine that describes the brain of the machine and not its body; it can drive a car, play a game, and perform diverse sophisticated jobs. AI is a field that falls at the intersections of several other domains, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Languages Processing, Context Awareness, and Data Security and Privacy. Figure 1 illustrates the intersections and relationship of the AI field with related fields.
